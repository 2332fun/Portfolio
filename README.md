# Portfolio

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to create a personalized porfolio that displays my strengths and experience as a coder. My efforts have shown my grasp on css (styling, borders, flex) and html (links, favicon, coding structure). I learned how to use backgrounds to create psuedo-objects for better spacing on the page. My project should stand out as unique and original.
